# Body Check App

## Description
The Body Check App project aims to empower children, disabled individuals, and their families by providing a user-friendly platform that facilitates better understanding and listening to one's body. Spearheaded by a pediatric occupational therapist based in Melbourne, the app seeks to instill regular body check-ins through personalized reminders and guided exercises.

At its core, the Body Check App serves as a digital companion, offering timely prompts for users to pause and assess their physical and emotional states. Through a friendly character interface, users will receive tailored messages encouraging them to connect with their bodies and explore their sensations. By integrating structured body check tasks into everyday routines, the app aims to promote emotional regulation and energy management, particularly beneficial for young disabled individuals and their support networks.
